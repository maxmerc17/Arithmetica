Today:
- add an amimation to the timer

Another Day:
- make icon (?)
- display high scores in a chart
- calculate average time to solve a problem
- get some feedback from others
- add guest mode - scores won't be saved
- do division precise to 1 decimal point (currently rounded down to the next whole number)
- time in seconds should be time in minutes when it is appropriate throughout the app

Dad feedback:
- clicked on name instead of number for dropdown — dropdown not obvious
- sqrt  icon misleading
- immediately tried to change lower bound to a value that was too great — consider using slider - more intuitive and more fail safe
- not obvious where to start when game began
- didn’t realize a new equation popped up - make equation larger - use the space
